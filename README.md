# cDCGAN
Pytorch implementation of cDCGAN.<br>
During my studies I had a lot of trouble finding a cDCGAN architecture that worked as I expected, so I decided to write my own version, finding an alternative way to condition it.<br />
Nothing particularly new, but it can be useful for educational purposes.<br />
This was used as a comparison with our meta-DCGAN-{1,2} MLP and meta-WGAN-gp 2MLP architectures<br />
