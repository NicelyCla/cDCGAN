# cDCGAN
During my internship in the laboratory I had to deal with GANs. It was an experience that I will always carry with me.
The topic fascinated me a lot.<br />
During my studies I had a lot of trouble finding a cDCGAN architecture that worked as I expected, so I decided to write my own version, finding an alternative way to condition it.<br />
Nothing particularly new, but it can be useful for educational purposes.
was used as a comparison with our meta-DCGAN- {1,2} MLP and meta-WGAN-gp architectures<br />
